								<h2 class="major">ALbum Cover Collection</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/poster-7.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>These Album Covers were designed during my BFA Senior Project class during the Spring of 2023. During this semester-long project, I continued with my idea of music-marketing design. I am a huge sucker for all sorts of music, and had a big interest in this idea. After working towards making this idea a reality, I fell in love with the creative marketing aspect of my project, and thus, led me to creating a series of album covers and their consecutive marketing pieces. I tried my best to create products that would best suit the genre as a sought-after keepsake or souvenir. Enjoy!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/ Ballad magazine Mockup.png" alt="" />Magazine Mockup for "Ballad"</span>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/buttaflies (5).png" alt="" />Up-Close Magazine Cover</span>
								<p>My personal favorite of my designs, this pop-album concept creates an atomosphere of smooth beats with some R&B influence. I imagine the singer, "Mariposa" has loved singing her whole life, made an album to reflect on that, and eventually became well-loved by all music lovers!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/madre album -4.png" alt="" />Album Cover for "Folk band", "Ven√ºst"</span>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/website pt-02.png" alt="" />"Website" shot 2</span>
								<p>This album cover was the last one I finished, and I had decided to create a website concept to go with it! Many Folk bands, as well as most bands, sell alot of their merchandise online, after their audience lives in-the-moment at their concerts. E-commerce is a great way to sell merchandise for any business, and works especially well in the music industry, and I wanted to showcase that with this piece!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/TICKET REDESIGN (1).png" alt="" />Ticket Design Back</span>
								<p>With this rock band album cover, I thought that tickets would be a unique thing to re-design. After creating the album cover itself, I had a solid foundation to start with for the ticket designs and used the same blue color scheme. This was a success! In the "Ticket Design Back" photo, the gradient represents a reflective panel with lyrics that I made up from the album! It Turned out to be my second favorite piece! (Maybe my namesake had something to do with that!)</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/t-shirt mockup (crestfallen) (1) copy.png" alt="" />T-Shirt Mockup Design</span>
								<p>This was one of my first album cover designs, and I thoroughly enjoy it! I definitely tried to create products that I could even see myself purchasing or using, and this was one of them! This album cover is among my favorite three, and I imagine that it would be very successful if it were a real-life product. The color scheme plays into the moody, angsty tones of the emo-rock genre, and I think the t-shirt would have no problem selling-out at any of Crestfallen's shows!</p>

								<h2 class="major">Indie Album & Vinyl Design</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/New Work/Albums+/vinyl-1.png" alt="" />Vinyl Mockup Design</span>
								<p>This album cover design reminds me of a lesser-known, "underground" indie band that loves to create soft yet catchy melodies, and draw in crowds of music lovers. Creating a Vinyl Record design was very beneficial for this band, especially since vinyl records have gained popularity again with the youth of today. The simple, indie design could easily be the focus of a photo on a fan's social media pages!</p>

								<p>During my short time working at Canine Country Club in Amarillo, TX, I learned lots about social media marketing. After working for just the Fall of 2022, I ended my internship with much more confidence in my knowledge of social media, and a continued eagerness to learn even more! I took many photos, and learn the best ways to efficiently edit them! It was a pleasure to work for this business, and I'm glad to have been a part of the team!</p>

								<p>During this project in a graphic design class, we were tasked with creating a concept package design for classic movie monster-themed beverages. I decided to put my creativity to the test and came up with these healthy drink ideas! If you look closely at the ingredients on the second panel, you will be able to see that all of the farms listed are actual, real-life local farms from all across the U.S. I ran with the idea of using simplistic, yet modern and themed design to intrigue the customer, and ultimatley create more profit!</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Background pics/headshot for website-6.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p class="text-indent"></p>I grew up in the Texas Hill Country, and currently reside in the beautiful area of Leakey, TX, where the Frio River is! I love to travel, learn new things, build new connections, and bring new ideas to any team. I have the hospitality that comes with being from a small town, and can work well with a team just as I can solo!</p>
								<p>I attended West Texas A&M University in Canyon, TX, and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. While attending WTAMU, I improved my design skills and learned a lot about the graphic design scene. My experience there made me well-prepared to take on any and all challenges that may arise in the future. I love brainstorming, team-building, and result-focused work. I believe that as designers we are responsible for not only having fun with our work, but providing a sound, balanced, and unique product for any business to use, and I will try my best to make that happen!</p>
